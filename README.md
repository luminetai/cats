# cats
A utility named after my little cats, who love cleaning up on my tables, shelves, and cabinets. They knock all the unnecessary things off onto the floor, leaving only the most important and useful ones. This utility works in the same way: it helps send only the necessary files and data to your clipboard, keeping your workflow clean and focused on the important parts of development.

Hereâ€™s how you can write it in English in your `README.md`:

## Installation and Usage

To install and run the `cats` program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luminetai/cats/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This command will automatically download and install the necessary files on your computer and create a symbolic link for easy access to the program.

Once installed, you can use the `cats` command to perform tasks.
